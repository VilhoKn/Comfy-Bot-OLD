Remember that there are people that love and care about you. And if you think there isn't, i will always be here for you!-me
Stay positive, better days are on their way!-me
May your troubles be less and your blessings be more-me
May your clothes be comfy, your coffee be strong, and your monday be short-me
Be perfectly comfortable going nowhere in life-me
Sometimes, you find yourself in the middle of nowhere, and sometimes, in the middle of nowhere, you find yourself-me
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone-me
Tears are words the heart can't express-me
